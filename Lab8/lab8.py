    Given an item and its colour, update its record with the new_price.
    Once you make the update, don't forget to write it in the file.

    REQ: item and colour should be valid (the record should exist
    in the database) and the new_price has to be a number greater than 0.

    Example:
    >>> get_item_price("pants", "grey")
    60
    >>> update_price("pants", "grey", 70)
    Item price was successfully updated!
    >>> get_item_price("pants", "grey")
    70

    Now, if we do:
    >>> update_price("notebook", "pink", 6)
    Item price was successfully updated!
    >>> update_price("notebook", "pink", 4)
    Item price was successfully updated!
    >>> get_item_price("notebook", "pink")
    ?????  <- What should this be?

def purchase_items(item, colour, items_bought):
    ''' (str, str, int) -> NoneType

    Given an item, its colour and the amount of items purchased, update its
    record with the new updated inventory quantity left. The input items_bought
    is the amount of items the costumer has bought, so now we need to update it
    in our database. Once you make the update, don't forget to write it in
    the file.

    REQ: item and colour should be valid (the record should exist
    in the database) and items_bought has to be a number greater than 0 and
    less than the current quantity.

    Example:
    >>> get_item_quantity("pants", "grey")
    80
    >>> purchase_items("pants", "grey", 3)
    Item quantity was successfully updated!
    >>> get_item_quantity("pants", "grey")
    77

    Now, if we do:
    >>> purchase_items("pants", "grey", 5)
    Item quantity was successfully updated!
    >>> purchase_items("pants", "grey", 6)
    Item quantity was successfully updated!
    >>> update_price("pants", "grey", 75)
    Item price was successfully updated!
    >>> purchase_items("pants", "grey", 3)
    Item quantity was successfully updated!
    >>> get_item_quantity("pants", "grey")
    ?????  <- What should this be?
