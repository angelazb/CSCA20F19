# CSCA20F19 - Sample Project: Store

This project is built based on Lab 8. Now we have cooler functions and we can get more info from our file, as well as we can do some shopping! Call the `can_i_buy` function to enter your shopping list and budget to see if you can afford it. 

## Requirements

- Python3

## Build and Run

- Download all files on the same folder.
- Double-click `store.py` to run. Make sure you close `store_items.csv` before calling any function.
